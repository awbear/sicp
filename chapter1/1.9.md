For the first, the expansion like:

```scheme
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc  8)
9
```
So it's a recursive process.

For the second, the expansion like:

```scheme
(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 9)
(+ 0 9)
9
```
So it's a iterative process.
